  - title: "Poppy & Bagel: How to FAIRly curate, process, and share your neuroimaging datasets"
    link: "https://neurobagel.org/nipoppy/overview/"
    image: neurobagel_logo.png
    details: |
      Curating data, running reproducible pipelines, creating data dictionaries, integrating data from collaborators, making sensitive data FAIR - these tasks are hard; and we all have to deal with them every day. Here we aim to serve Nipoppy and Neurobagel - a set of protocols and tools with modular framework that one can adopt as needed to simplify common data organization, processing, harmonization, and sharing tasks on neuroimaging datasets.

      We cover BIDSification, containerized processing with completion tracking, annotation of phenotypic data, and generation of knowledge graphs for distributed data discovery and sharing.

      This is a useful project for those who:

      - Feel frustrated replicating work by others or even reproducing your own work from 6 months ago
      - Struggle with BIDSification of data
      - Spend endless hours trying to match column names in tabular data files
      - Work with multi-site datasets
      - Support open-science but work with datasets that have privacy issues
      - Want to create a community to build a common ecosystem

      We have experienced all these issues ourselves in the past, and so we are here to prevent future grief to newcomers!

    image: logo.svg
    details: |
      Besides `BIDS`' success, expansion, and description of multiple data modalities, gaps still exist in developing the standard to effectively support the process of scientific results reporting. Among others, this prominently refers to data obtained through and during connectivity analyses. This comprises brain parcellations, connectivity maps, structural and functional connections, major white matter tracts, diffusion signal models, white matter tractograms and tractometry, as well as networks based on dimensionality reduction. Sharing processed data and features in addition to raw and minimally processed data is critical to accelerating scientific discovery. This is because substantial effort, software, and hardware instrumentation, and know-how are required to bring raw data to a usable state. The aim of the present project is to extend the BIDS standard to encompass derivatives resulting from experiments related to macroscopic brain connectivity (U.S. National Institutes of Health NIMH R01-MH126699). During the Brainhack, we would like to

      - Finalize the existing BEPs ([BEP17 - Relationship matrices](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ugBdUF6dhElXdj3u9vw0iWjE6f_Bibsro3ah7sRV0GA/edit?usp=sharing), [BEP38 - Atlases](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/1714), [BEP39 - Dimensionality reduction-based networks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GTWsj0MFQedXjOaNk6H0or6IDVFyMAysrJ9I4Zmpz2E/edit?usp=sharing))
      - Gather feedback from experts, users, tool developers, ie everyone!
      - Discuss next steps, e.g. software integrations

    link: "https://github.com/Inria-Empenn/narps_open_pipelines"
    image: narps.png
    details: |
      The goal of the NARPS Open Pipelines project is to create a codebase reproducing the 70 pipelines of the NARPS study (Botvinik-Nezer et al., 2020) and share this as an open resource for the community. We base our reproductions on the original descriptions provided by the teams and test the quality of the reproductions by comparing our results with the original results published on NeuroVault. 

      The Neuroimaging Analysis Replication and Prediction Study (NARPS-[Botvinik-Nezer et al., 2020)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7771346/) aimed to provide the first scientific evidence on the variability of results across analysis teams in neuroscience. 70 teams were asked to analyze the same dataset (task-fMRI with 108 participants) and then, to provide their methods and results to be later analyzed and compared. 

      We would like to focus on these tasks during the Brainhack:

      - Start writing the pseudo code of a pipeline based on the knowledge of participants (i.e.: which fMRI analysis software they are used to, whether they use Python or not, ...)
      - Start reproducing the pipeline from the pseudo code, 
      - Improving documentation and accessibility of the project.

    details: |
      The Neuroimaging zombies projects aims at providing guidelines on how to test whether an effect from the literature is replicable (more than reproducible), and how to prevent our own results to turn into irreplicable effects.

      We propose to work on our 3 axes:
      - preprocess a public dataset with your favourite tool and upload the results to GIN
      - work on reference Quality Control
      - work on the reference pipelines for some well established neuroimaging results

    details: |
      As a part of a study to examine the interplay between brain, behavior, and cognition, seven sites internationally have simulated longitudinal datasets of how they envision these interactions to occur. Each site generated three sets of of data, each with 10,000 participants over seven waves, ranging from 7 to 20 years of age. Each site generated these datasets independently and our keeping the key to what they embedded into the data secret. The goal of this brainhack project is to try and determine the hidden developmental treasures hidden within each dataset.

  - title: "Psy2R - an R package for better inference in multivariate statistical analysis"
    link: "https://github.com/kel-github/PSY2R"
    image: Psy2R-logo.jpeg
    details: |
      We consistently use massive datasets across neuroscience and psychology. The routine gathering of big data requires that we are well equipped with tools that allow us to conduct appropriate multivariate statistics. This project aims to produce an R package that allows the researcher to overcome little discussed limitations of traditional multivariate statistical analyses.

      Multivariate statistical analysis (e.g. MANOVA and repeated-measures ANOVA) typically follows a two stage procedure; an omnibus test of the global null hypothesis followed by post-hoc tests of specific effects. It is not well known that under certain circumstances, such as when the omnibus test is overpowered, that the type 1 error rate for this procedure is drastically inflated, sometimes to a type 1 error rate of 1! It is even less well known that this procedure can lead to an even lessor known type IV error, which is the incorrect interpretation of a correctly rejected hypothesis. This is caused when the follow-up contrasts are inadequate to test the question of interest, as can occur when testing simple effects.

      It is possible to avoid these dragons by using an alternative procedure where all inferences are derived from simultaneous confidence intervals (SCIs) on contrasts of interests. The 'simultaneous' bit means that the same statistic contributes to both the omnibus and the contrast tests for significance, which controls the type 1 error rate. Even better, computing confidence intervals on contrasts of interests allows reseachers to move away from binary decision-making (is something significant or not?) to interpretations involving magnitude (how big is this effect likely to be at the population level?).

      One piece of software (PSY) can produce SCIs appropriate for both planned analyses (where contrasts are defined independently of the data) and for more flexible analyses where contrasts are defined on a post-hoc basis. However, this software is only available for use on windows and cannot be scripted into reproducible workflows. Our goal is to build an R package that implements the functions of PSY, and to make this method of statistical inference available to the masses!

      Our goals for OHBM Brainhack 2024 are:
      1. Convert some key functions of the Psy source pascal code to R functions: these functions compute the largest contrast effect you could expect to get if the null hypothesis is true, when you have between and within repeated measures.
      2. Explore the overlap between Psy, emmeans and MBESS, to make sure we recycle where appropriate
      3. Replicate analyses between the original Psy software and the R implementation

  - title: "Nilearn: Statistics and Machine Learning for Neuroimaging in Python"
    link: "https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn"
    image: Nilearn.svg
    details: |
      Nilearn is an open-source Python package for fast and easy analysis and visualization of MRI brain images. It provides statistical and machine-learning tools, with instructive documentation and a friendly community. It includes applications such as multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), decoding, predictive modelling, functional connectivity, and brain parcellations.

      Recent work in Nilearn has been centered on developing a new API to allow users to seamlessly work with surface data in a manner similar to volumetric data, enhancing support for the General Linear Model (GLM), enhancing the BIDS interface, and improving and updating the infrastructure and codebase.

      We want to dedicate these Brainhack days towards direct interaction with our user-base and resolving any specific issues they might have. To this end, we encourage users to simply pop-in-and-say-hi. They are also welcome to present their queries via neurostars.org or open new issues/PRs on our GitHub repo. In addition, any interested contributors are also encouraged to work on pre-existing issues on our GitHub. To get started, new contributors should look for the "Good First Issue" or "Hackathon" labels.

      When planning for a training event for reproducible research, there are many training materials to choose from to teach tools such as git/github, bash, datalad, etc. There are inventories of such training material in some places (ReproRehab, INCF training space, Hitchhicker guide to the brain, etc) but we are lacking i) a set of tags to annotate training material (duration, targeted audience, etc) ii) a place where there can be some crowd curation and annotation of these materials.
      We propose to develop a set of tags and an inventory of training material for reproducible neuroimaging that can be reused by other resources and be crowd-curated. This project is under the auspices of the INCF-ReproNim train the trainer fellowship.

  - title: "Hack your RF coil"
    link: "https://layerfmri.com/2024brainhack/"
    image: rfcoil.png
    details: |
      There are more than 100 7T scanners installed around the world and virtually all of them are equipped with an 32ch RF coils from Nova Medical. In the last decade, this coil model has evolved from a niche engineering challenge for prototype scanners to a mainstream FDA-approved medical product. Despite the current abundance of this coil, there are no public quality metrics about it's stability, consistency across sites, nor across models of single channel transmit (sTx) and multi-channel transmit (pTx).

      However, these QA metrics are vital for the upcoming transition of most 7T scanners. Namely, until now almost all 7T scanners were used as single-channel transit systems (e.g. SIEMENS Magentom 7T, classic and Terra). But the new generation of FDA-approved 7T scanners that are solely used as parallel transmit systems (e.g. SIEMENS Terra.X). While the common pTx Nova coil has been successfully validated for a number of clinical imaging protocols, it has never been compared with the sTX coil for highly accelerated fMRI protocols. 

      Pilot experiments suggest that the pTx coil performs worse in tSNR limited fMRI protocols. This is despite the fact that the transmit performance is improved.

      The goals of this project is to:
      1. We cant to learn and describe basic QA procedures of 7T RF-coils.
      3. We want to characterize the differences of noise characteristics in fMRI protocols across different coil models; pTx and sTx.
      5. We want to engage with the community to gather and compare basic QA metrics across scanners.

      We hope that these results will be informative as reference data for any 7T sights that are unsure if their SNR is at the optimal level. Furthermore, we hope that findings of this project will pave the way for cross-site large neuroimaging studies
